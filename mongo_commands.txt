#Installation of Mongo DB With Brew package manager

* Install MongoDB binaries
brew install mongodb

* To build from source files and include SSL
brew install mongodb --with -openssl

* To install the lates development release for use in testing and development
brew install mongodb --devel

#Creating the first database

* For starting the mongoDB server
mongod

* For connecting to mongoDB server
mongo

* For creating a database (use is the command for creating the database)
use database_name (this command modify db to point to the database)


* For creating a collection under database and we used insert to insert data on that collection
db.collection_name.insert({field:value, field:value})

* For find all documents in a collection
db.articles.find()

* To see the document in a pretty format (will print out as formatted JSON)
db.articles.find().pretty()

# Creating a document and saving it to collection

* Lets start by creating the document
var articleInfo = {};

*Populating our articleInfo document with different fields
articleInfo.articleName = "MongoDB Introduction";
articleInfo.authorName = "Noyan AYDIN";
articleInfo.tags = ["database", "NoSQL", "DBA", "Dev"];
articleInfo.metaData = {};
articleInfo.metaData.authors = ["Noyan", "Mehmet"];
articleInfo.metaData.description = "About MongoDB";
articleInfo.metaData.created_on = new Date();

*Save the document to the articles collection
db.articles.save(articleInfo);

* In MongoDB save and insert acts differently
Save behaves differently if it is passed with an "_id" parameter.
If the document contains an _id field, then the save() method performs an upsert querying the collection on the _id field:
If a document does not exist with the specified _id value, the save() method performs an insert with the specified fields in the document.
If a document exists with the specified _id value, the save() method performs an update, replacing all field in the existing record with the fields from the document.
